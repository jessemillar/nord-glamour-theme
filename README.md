# Nord Theme for Glamour

[![Man Hours](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmh.jessemillar.com%2Fhours%3Frepo%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjessemillar%2Fnord-glamour-theme.git)](https://jessemillar.com/r/man-hours)

[`glamour`](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glamour) is the Markdown renderer used by the [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli). I'd like the colors used when rendering Markdown to match [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/) (my color theme of choice).

The GitHub CLI currently does not have a way to set the `glamour` theme that is used. I'll likely have to create a PR to add that functionality.
